Domainify is an open-source and lightweight library created based on Clean Architecture and DDD (Domain-Driven Design) approaches. This library helps developers boost the development process to produce scaled Backed-End and implement details like invariants, and specifications, and further helps them to architect complexity easily. It provides a strong and flexible structure for developers to focus on business logic.

One of the biggest concerns developers have is scalability and how to design a project in the best way they can develop and scale. Some developers try to develop projects based on clean architecture, test-driven development practices, and further domain-driven design too, It is helpful and can be effective. But for some developers, there are some misunderstandings and during the development, some needs will appear and they do not know how to solve them and implement them correctly. Often it takes much time and is costly too. Therefore, a suitable infrastructure is important to start a project.

In the following, you will learn how to use Domainify in your project, you will learn how to correctly implement a Backend service according to DDD (Domain-Driven Design) practices.
Notice that This tutorial has been written for implementing a project based on DDD by Domainify, not based on DDD rules completely. For How to implement a project based on DDD rules and TDD without using any libraries, you can refer to this source on GitHub [ddd-tdd-workshop](https://github.com/arashtafakori/ddd-tdd-workshop).

This is the first released version of Swift since 1.0.1.6.

The tutorial of this version covers the following topics:

- How to implement domain model includes entities and requests of query or command type and set boundaries.
- How to implement validations and invariants.
- How to implement complex specifications simply.
- How to implement complex specifications simply.
- How to implement persistence based on SQL Entity-framework and Mongo-DB
- How to implement Application Service layer and orchestrating resolving requests.
- How to configure a demagnified project.
- Implementing APIs as presentation layers. 
- Implementing acceptance tests.
